Hi folks,

We've put this off long enough, but EqBeats is now Free Software! The code is
licenced under the BSD-3 license, and is available to view, reuse, or contribute
to, in [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/eqbeats/eqbeats/).

Moving to GitHub also means we get a bugtracker so direct all your bug reports
and feature requests to it [here](https://github.com/eqbeats/eqbeats/issues/).

Thanks to Nido, Valodim and Igor for answering our call to developers and giving
us the push we needed to get rolling again.
