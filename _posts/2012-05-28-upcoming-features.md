Hey,

Sorry for the lack of updates recently, we've been quite busy this month, and June might be the same. Here are some of the features you can expect by end of July:

First, we'll let you choose the license you want to use for your songs. You'll be able to set that for every single track or use the same license for all your songs.

Second, we may let you order your tracks on your profile page, or let you select your favorite track to feature it on your profile.

Third, we should also add a way to upload anything. Using the original MP3 (like we do) is probably the best option to prevent quality loss, but some people want to be able to use formats like FLAC anyway. We'll figure that out.

<p style="color: #999">Maybe some updates for hackers too.</p>

As usual, we might also tweak the design. We're not designers so don't expect anything magnificient. If you're a designer and want to help, you can send us a mail at contact@eqbeats.org or try to catch us on the chat (#eqbeats on irc.ponychat.net, or simply click the Chat link above).

We hope that we'll bring updates sooner though.

<p style="color:#999;">Also, EqBeats now hosts more than 1300 tracks and 200 artists.</p>
