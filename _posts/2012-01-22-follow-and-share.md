We've added yet some more changes to the site! There have been a few appearance changes like the new logo and icons, as well as a few new features. You now have the ability to follow artists and favorite tracks.

In other news, you may have heard of the official shutdown of Megaupload.com. For those of you who used to upload your music there, feel free to use EqBeats for any future songs. If you want to give a direct download to a song, simply add /mp3 at the end of the URL of the track you want to link. You could also right click on the "Download" button and copy the link. Either method will work.
