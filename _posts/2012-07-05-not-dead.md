So, as expected, June has been busy. Still, we've improved a few things, including our spam filter. EqBeats now supports module files (MOD, XM, IT, etc...) too.

We're also preparing a massive update of the software. This is going to take some time though, but the development should be boosted very soon. Expect new features.
