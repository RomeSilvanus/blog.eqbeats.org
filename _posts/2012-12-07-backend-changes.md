Hey folks,

We've just pushed out a big update today. It's mostly a rewrite of the backend, so you shouldn't see a lot of changes. However, this update was in the works for more than six months already, and prevented us from any kind of fast update-pushing, so finally seeing the end of that means we can start working on other, more interesting things again.

So if you have a feature you've always wanted to see, we're listening, on our [Github issue tracker][] or still via [Email][] or [IRC][]. Yes, [we already know][stats discussion] you guys want stats, and we'd like you to tell us what kind and at which density.

And of course, if you see a bug appear with the update, please let us know as soon as possible.
