We're shutting down. EqBeats has always been a two-person show and neither of us is willing to keep
maintaining EqBeats, and while it's been running fine unsupervised for the last year or so, it still
costs money to run every month, and we're not comfortable letting it run completely unmoderated.

### What is going to happen

On December 28th, 2015, EqBeats will stop accepting new tracks, new comments, sign-ups, and will
stop collecting statistics on tracks. We're going into archive mode. Everything will stay online
indefinitely, every track will still be available for playback and for download, we won't break any
links.

### What you should do about it

You're probably planning to move to another service. Tell us what kind of exporting tools you would
like. An archive file with all your tracks? Batch upload to SoundCloud? To Pony.fm? To another
service? Let us know and we'll do what we can.

You can email us at <contact@eqbeats.org>, hop into our IRC channel, `#eqbeats` on
`irc.ponychat.net`, or you can tweet me [@codl](https://twitter.com/codl).
