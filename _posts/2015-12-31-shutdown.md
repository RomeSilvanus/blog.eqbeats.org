As announced a few months ago, EqBeats has gone into archival mode. We're no longer
accepting new tracks or collecting comments and statistics on existing tracks. All
of the songs, playlists, user profiles remain online, and will remain so indefinitely.

Again, the reason behind this move is that both of us have lost interest in maintaining EqBeats, and with the rise of other platforms run by people who are far more involved in the community than we were, retiring was the most sensible option.

Your data is still yours of course so if you'd like some or all of your tracks taken
down, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@eqbeats.org">contact@eqbeats.org</a>
and we'll do it, no questions asked. You can also
<a href="https://eqbeats.org/takeout">download an archive</a> of all of your tracks,
along with all the statistics we've been collecting on them.
We also have a tool in the works to help you migrate to <a href="https://pony.fm">Pony.fm</a>, look for it sometime in the next few weeks.

We're very thankful for every single one of you, those of you who trusted us with your creations, those of you who regularily came back to check the newest uploads, those of you who built exciting things on top of our API. Thank you so much for being with us. Until next time.
