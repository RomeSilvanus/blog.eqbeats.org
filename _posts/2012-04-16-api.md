Hiya!

We thought of the nerds among you, and realized we hadn't done much for you. So we added a simple [JSON API](http://eqbeats.org/api). Hope you like it!

Also, we're working on playlists. Expect to see those by the end of the week. Or don't, then you can act all surprised when they come out.

<p style="color: #999;">Oh and there's another thing coming that will probably save you both time and bandwidth. Hint: it involves Youtube. Hint 2: probably not in the way you're thinking. It'll take a while though so don't get too excited.</p>
