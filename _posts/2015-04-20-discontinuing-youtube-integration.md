As the YouTube API that we were using to provide automatic YouTube uploads has been shut down, we are discontinuing the YouTube upload feature.

If you have linked your YouTube and EqBeat accounts in the past, our access to your YouTube account should have been revoked automatically, but if you wish you may check [your Google permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions) and make sure that EqBeats is not in that list.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
