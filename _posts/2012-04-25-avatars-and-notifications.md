Hey,

Have some features:

We've added avatar support to the profiles. It uses the avatars on [gravatar.com][]. If you already have one there, you don't have anything to do. Otherwise you can just click the default avatar and be redirected.

[gravatar.com]: http://gravatar.com/

Also, EqBeats will now email you when someone posts a comment on one of your track or on your profile page. You can disable this by unchecking "Email notification" in your [account edition page][1].
